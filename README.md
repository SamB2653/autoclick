# Autoclick
A simple Python3 script which moves / clicks the mouse when executed. Useful for preventing a computer from locking
when running long scripts.

## Options  
Simple preset functions are prompted when the script is executed:  
* Left - Will randomly move the mouse after detecting screen size and click the top left corner of the screen  
* Right - Functions the same as the "Left" option but clicks the top right of the screen  
* No-Click - Will randomly move the mouse within the screen bounds but not click  

## End the Script  
End the script by moving the mouse to one of the corners of the screen or via keyboard interrupt (CTRL-C).
